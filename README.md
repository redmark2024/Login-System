# Login-System
This code allows a user to first set their username and password. Then, during the sign-in process, the user is prompted to enter their username and password. The system checks if the entered credentials match the stored ones and grants access if they are correct; otherwise, it denies access and exits the program.


How it works:
Set Username and Password: The first part allows the user to set their username and password.
Sign-In Process: Then, the user is asked to enter their username and password to sign in.
Credential Check: It compares the entered username and password with the stored ones and grants or denies access accordingly.
